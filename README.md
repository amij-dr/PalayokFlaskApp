**Palayok** is a web-based application designed to help users discover, save, and enjoy Filipino recipes. Derived from the Filipino word "palayok," which refers to a traditional clay pot, the app serves as a digital vessel for Filipino culinary heritage. It features a curated collection of traditional and modern Filipino recipes scraped from *Panlasang Pinoy*, a well-known Filipino food website by Vanjo Merano.
